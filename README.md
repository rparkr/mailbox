[Access the web app here](https://marimo.io/p/@rparker/mailbox?show-code=false)

A simple app for teaching children about letters and how letters are combined to create words.

# Background

Most alphabet resources use "starts with" to teach about letters: "**A** is for **a**pple" 🍎, "**B** is for **b**us" 🚌, etc. Though helpful, I have noticed that young children tend to recognize letters by _prominence_ in a word -- for example, the **g** in e**gg** is a more prominent sounding letter than the **e**, and a more prominent use of **e** might be found in tr**ee**.

To enable learning how letters are placed within words, this app lists words that contain a given letter at selected positions within a word: beginning, middle, or end.
